            <h1>How does ironworks affect ecology?</h1>
            <p>During production processes lots of CO₂ and CO gases are released. CO is toxic and has dark color and
                smoke smell. Both gases are greenhouse.</p>
            <h2>Kazakhstan</h2>
            <p>Temirtau where the industry resides, is in the list of top 10 polluted cities in the world by IQAir
                international organization. In 2018 the snow was dark due to pollution.

                The Karaganda Metallurgical Plant, along with the Temirtau Electrometallurgical Plant's chemical and
                metallurgical plant, is the main air polluter in Temirtau. ArcelorMittal Temirtau(now Qarmet) and
                Kazakhmys account
                for
                up to 70% of the total emissions in the Karaganda region.

            <h2>Future</h2>
            <p>In 2024, in order to reduce its environmental impact, Qarmet began implementing a gasification project
                for its production facilities, which is the largest environmental project in the plant's history.</p>

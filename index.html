            <h2>WTF is iron and cast iron?</h2>
            <p>Iron is a chemical element; it has symbol Fe (from Latin ferrum 'iron') and atomic number 26. It is a
                metal
                that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table. It is, by mass, the most
                common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most abundant
                element in the Earth's crust. In its metallic state it was mainly deposited by meteorites. </p>
            <p>Cast iron is a class of iron–carbon alloys with a carbon content of more than 2% and silicon content
                around
                1–3%.[1] Its usefulness derives from its relatively low melting temperature. The alloying elements
                determine
                the form in which its carbon appears: white cast iron has its carbon combined into the iron carbide
                compound
                cementite, which is very hard, but brittle, as it allows cracks to pass straight through; grey cast iron
                has
                graphite flakes which deflect a passing crack and initiate countless new cracks as the material breaks,
                and
                ductile cast iron has spherical graphite "nodules" which stop the crack from further progressing. </p>
